    Patient Profile: A 32-year-old woman presented on April 10, 2023, with "4 spontaneous abortions and currently 5 weeks of pregnancy." She had experienced four previous spontaneous abortions, all occurring in the early stages of pregnancy (<12 weeks), with no obvious symptoms of threatened abortion, family history of genetic diseases, or chronic illnesses. An ultrasound at 5 weeks of pregnancy suggested an intrauterine early pregnancy. The patient was anxious and requested further examination and treatment. Physical examination showed a body temperature of 36.7°C, pulse rate of 80 beats/min, respiratory rate of 17 beats/min, and blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg. Cardiothoracic auscultation was normal, the abdomen was flat with no tenderness or rebound pain, and the gynecological examination revealed a normal uterus size for 5 weeks of pregnancy.
    
    Diagnostic Findings: Blood routine and coagulation function were normal. Thyroid function was normal. Reproductive immunity tests revealed positive anticardiolipin antibody (ACL) IgM and anti-beta 2 glycoprotein 1 antibody (beta 2-GP1) IgG. Reproductive endocrine examination was normal. Ultrasound confirmed an intrauterine early pregnancy with visible fetal bud and cardiac pulsation. Chromosome examination of both spouses was normal.
</input>

<output>
    Initial Diagnosis: Recurrent Abortion due to Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS).

    Treatment Plan: Anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 5000 U subcutaneously twice daily and aspirin (LDA) 100 mg orally once daily. Luteal support with dydrogesterone tablets 10 mg orally twice daily. Regular monitoring of blood coagulation function and antibody levels every 2 weeks, and ultrasound every 3 weeks to monitor embryo development.

    Prognosis: APS is a significant cause of recurrent abortion. With standard anticoagulant therapy, the pregnancy success rate can reach 70%-80%.
